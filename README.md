# Introduction

This is a collection of machine learnining algorithms and assignments, which are a part of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera as well as Stanford's CS231N course. I plan to implement all the algorithms taught and complete these assignments in python instead of Matlab/Octave.

I'm making use of Jupyter Notebook and the python libraries matplotlib, numpy and pandas.
