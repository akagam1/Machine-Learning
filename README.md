# Introduction

This is a collection of machine learnining algorithms and assignments, which are a part of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. I plan to implement all the algorithms taught and complete these assignments in python instead of Matlab/Octave. I might even add some insights of my own and things I learned along the way.

I'm making use of Jupyter Notebook and the python libraries matplotlib and numpy.
